# d2mr-assessment: "Quarto Set Up, Descriptive Statistics and Hypotheses Testing"

Objectives:

This assessment aims to satisfy assessed and assessed goals in the following areas:

1. Basic R set up 
2. Quarto set up
3. APA formatting and reference
4. Creating figures using ggplot2
5. Perform statistical analyses, including descriptive and hypotheses testing, and present the results in a proper way.
6. Render to PDF.

The dataset being used in the assessment is 'math-anxiety.csv' from Natalie's '04_data-analysis' folder.
You may also notice that a lot of instructions are also from the original '04_data-analysis/01_descriptive/descriptive-stats.qmd' file.
That is because I was originally doing this task but then thought I could play around with this task and meet extra unique goals.
However, the end product did turnout to be quite messy and I apologize for that :( 
I promise that I will do better in  my final research project.
